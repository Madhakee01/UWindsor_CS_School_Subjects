Q1) 	-z checks the string and returns True if the length of string is zero.

Q2)     "$1" holds the first parameter from the input string. If there is no braces, 
	the computer assumes it as an argument($) and tries to expand it.

Q3) 	Exit codes can be used to change the flow of execution depending on the success
	or failure of commands executed. Normally exit 1 refers to success (true) and 
	exit 0 refers to failure (false).

Q4) 
	Util_is_avail function checks whether a utility is available on the system. The 
	benefit is that the function checks for the utility on the systems and returns 
	$1 to the screen for failure and along with name of the utility. (so the user 
	can later install the utility as needed based on the return value of the function). 
	Almost every other arguments use the utility from the needed list(line 24-30), 
	so this function is important. 
	
Q5)	TMP_FILE_R is assigned to the mktemp command which takes in a given file name and creates 
	a unique file name. So, TMP_FILE_R holds a unique file name based on the given template 
	file name.

Q6)	 $TMP_FILE_R  holds the temporary file name created by mktemp. It is important to remove 
	the file because there is no use for it since it is stored A2PS_CMD and to avoid service 
	attacks it is better for it to be removed.

Q7) 	$TMP_FILE_M takes in the output title provided by roff2pdf that is created by the mktemp
	command and then it  redirects it to the $OUTPUT_FILE. SO, the output file will be of the 
	name OUTPUT_TITLE.

Q8)	This command redirects the value 2 for any process to the null device file, which then 
	throws it away everything in the file. It is useful when you don't want to save a file 
	consisting of information or if you want to hide the output.

Q9)	RETVAL is either equal to 0 or 1 because they statement $? returns true or false. 
	For example in line 119 - 123, if RETVAL is not equal to 0 then the message "error 
	accessing man pages" is printed. Then the current value of RETVAL is returned.
